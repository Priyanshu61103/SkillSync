      "Quantify achievements in both projects and experience (e.g., ‘Increased platform users by X%’, ‘Reduced bug reports by Y%’)[1].",
      "Tailor the resume for each job application by incorporating keywords from the job description to improve ATS compatibility[3][4].",
      "Include a LinkedIn profile link; this is now a standard expectation and supports your professional brand.",
      "Focus on the most relevant skills and remove or minimize less relevant hobbies/interests.",
      "Proofread carefully to eliminate typos and formatting inconsistencies.",
      "Consider condensing the resume to one page, focusing on the most impactful and relevant information[6].",
      "For each project, briefly state the problem, your solution, the technologies used, and the measurable impact.",

      "Active content creator with a YouTube channel, indicating communication skills and a passion for teaching—valuable for roles requiring team collaboration and mentorship.",
      "Diverse technical skills across languages (Python, C++, JavaScript), frameworks (Flask, Django, React.js), and tools (Docker, Git, PowerBI).",
      "Relevant internship experience contributing to a live project, including feature development, user management, and payment integration.",
      "Multiple achievements in technical competitions and conferences, highlighting problem-solving and presentation abilities.",

      "Resume lacks a professional summary or objective statement—crucial for quickly communicating career goals and value proposition to recruiters.",
      "No LinkedIn profile link is provided in the contact section, which is a standard expectation for technical roles.",
      "Work experience section is underdeveloped; the internship could be expanded with more specific achievements, metrics, and outcomes (e.g., user growth, system improvements).",
      "Project descriptions are somewhat generic; they would benefit from quantifiable results (e.g., user base, performance metrics, impact).",
      "The resume does not clearly follow a standard structure; sections are inconsistently formatted, and the use of non-standard symbols (e.g., §, ï, Æ) is distracting and unprofessional.",
      "No mention of ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization, such as tailored keywords or clear section headings, which is critical in 2025 for getting past initial screening[3][4].",
      "Some skills and interests (e.g., investing, meditation) are not directly relevant to technical roles and could be streamlined to focus on core competencies.",
      "The resume exceeds one page without clear justification—best practice is to keep it concise, especially for early-career candidates[6].",
